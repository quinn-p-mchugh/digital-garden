Your [[Attention\|attention]] is a limited resource, continuously consumed by  by any number of things, such as information, relationships, activities, and commitments. These attention-grabbing inputs can be broadly grouped into two categories:
1. Signal
2. Noise

**"Signal"** refers to anything that competes for your attention but you find *relevant*, *meaningful*, or *valuable* in some way. This could be things like:
- Newsletters you find personally meaningful
- Recommendations for movies you end up loving
- News that causes a positive change in your behavior
- Etc

**"Noise"** refers to anything that competes for your attention but you do *not* find relevant, meaningful, or valuable. This could be things like:
- Marketing emails
- Spam calls
- Group chats that don't concern you
- Reddit threads that might be entertaining but are ultimately a distraction
- Etc

If you're striving to live a life with purpose and intentionality, a good [[Topics/Psychology & Rationality/Heuristic\|heuristic]] is to try and increase your life's **signal-to-noise ratio**:  

$$ {Signal-to-Noise Ratio} = \frac{{Signal}}{Noise} $$

That is, out of all the things - information, relationships, activities, and commitments - that are vying for your attention, you should aim to increase the things that you consider "signal" and [[Topics/Information Management/Reducing Noise\|eliminate the things you consider "noise."]] What you consider "signal" and "noise" is entirely up to you and [[Aim\|your life's priorities]].
